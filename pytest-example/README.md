## Pytest Teaching tool
Used for the Week 4 ACM.Industry workshop

### Setup
1) Clone this repo
2) Initialize (and activate) a virtual environment using your python manager of choice (I prefer [uv](https://astral.sh/uv))
3) Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Instructions
1) Look through the code in app.py
2) Use the skeleton test file at test.py to write good tests
3) Use `make test` and `make coverage-report` - Did you get 100% code coverage?

**Note**: You can view your coverage report in the browser by opening htmlcov/index.html once the coverage tool has finished running.
